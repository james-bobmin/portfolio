Suggestion:

copy the fonts folder into your main HERALD folder, so that this folder is at the same level as your CSS, JS and IMAGES folders.  

There is a fonts_css.txt document. Please copy the CSS from this text file and paste into your working stylesheet. If your stylesheet is in the correct CSS folder, then the path to the fonts should be ../fonts/  - which is correct in the txt document. You should be able to simply copy and paste the css into your working stylesheet.

The resources folder contains all the video files and the necessary JS and Flash files to make the Herald web page work. I would suggest that you copy the MEDIA folder into your main HERALD folder, at the same level as your FONTS folder.

Thank you and enjoy.
